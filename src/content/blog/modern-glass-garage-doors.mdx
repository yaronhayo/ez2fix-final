For contemporary homes, nothing beats the look of a full-view aluminum and glass garage door. They turn a functional entry point into a stunning architectural feature.

## The Look
These doors feature a grid of aluminum frames (available in black, bronze, anodized silver, etc.) holding glass panels. They allow maximum natural light into the garage during the day and glow warmly at night.

## Pros
*   **Curb Appeal:** Unmatched modern aesthetic.
*   **Light:** Transforms a dark garage into a bright, usable space.
*   **Durability:** Aluminum frames are rust-proof and lightweight.

## Cons
*   **Privacy:** Clear glass lets everyone see your messy garage. (Solution: Use frosted, tinted, or mirrored glass).
*   **Insulation:** Glass doesn't insulate as well as foam-filled steel, though insulated glass options are available.
*   **Cost:** These are premium doors and cost significantly more than standard steel doors.

## Beyond the Garage
We're seeing a trend of using glass garage doors as "moving walls" for indoor/outdoor living spaces, opening up living rooms or kitchens to the patio.
