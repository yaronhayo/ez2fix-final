If your garage is attached to your house, it's likely the biggest source of heat loss in your home. A thin, uninsulated metal garage door acts like a giant heat exchanger, letting cold in during winter and heat in during summer.

## Benefits of Insulation
1.  **Lower Energy Bills:** By keeping the garage temperature more stable, you reduce the load on your HVAC system, especially if you have rooms above the garage.
2.  **Durability:** Insulated doors (often "sandwich" construction with steel-foam-steel) are much stronger and less prone to denting than single-layer steel doors.
3.  **Quieter Operation:** The foam core dampens vibration, making the door significantly quieter when opening and closing.
4.  **Comfort:** If you use your garage as a workshop or gym, insulation makes it usable year-round.

## DIY Kits vs. New Door
*   **DIY Kits:** You can buy foam panel kits to glue onto your existing door. They help a little, but they add weight (which might require spring adjustment) and don't seal as well as a factory door.
*   **New Insulated Door:** The best option. Factory-insulated doors have higher R-values (thermal resistance) and better seals between sections.

## R-Value Matters
Look for an R-value of at least R-12 for attached garages in New Jersey. The higher the number, the better the insulation.
