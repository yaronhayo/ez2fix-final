Knowing the standard sizes of garage doors can save you money. Custom sizes are available but come with a custom price tag. Here are the industry standards.

## Single Car Garage Doors
These are designed for one vehicle.
*   **Width:** 8 feet, 9 feet (most common), or 10 feet.
*   **Height:** 7 feet (standard) or 8 feet (for taller SUVs/trucks).

## Double Car Garage Doors
These fit two vehicles side-by-side.
*   **Width:** 16 feet (most common) or 18 feet.
*   **Height:** 7 feet or 8 feet.

## RV and Oversized Doors
For RVs, boats, or workshops.
*   **Width:** 10, 12, or 14 feet.
*   **Height:** 10 to 14 feet.

## How to Measure
1.  **Width:** Measure the width of the finished opening (inside the jambs).
2.  **Height:** Measure from the floor to the bottom of the header.
3.  **Headroom:** Measure from the top of the door opening to the ceiling (you need 10-12 inches for standard tracks).
4.  **Backroom:** Measure the depth of the garage (door height + 18 inches).

## Custom Sizes
If your opening is non-standard (e.g., an old carriage house with a 7'3" opening), Ez2Fix can order custom-sized doors to fit perfectly.
