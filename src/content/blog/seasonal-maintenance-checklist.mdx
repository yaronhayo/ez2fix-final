Your garage door is the largest moving part of your home. Just like your car, it needs regular tune-ups to perform safely and efficiently. We recommend performing a thorough inspection twice a year: once in the Spring and once in the Fall.

## Visual Inspection
*   **Look at the Springs:** Are they rusty? Do they look stretched?
*   **Check the Cables:** Look for fraying or loose strands.
*   **Inspect the Rollers:** Are they chipped, cracked, or worn down?
*   **Examine the Hardware:** Check for loose bolts on the tracks and hinges.

## Operational Checks
*   **Listen:** Open and close the door. Is it louder than usual? Does it grind or squeak?
*   **Balance Test:** Disconnect the opener and lift the door manually. It should lift smoothly and stay open at waist height.
*   **Safety Reverse Test:** Place a 2x4 board flat on the ground in the center of the opening. Close the door. It should reverse automatically when it hits the wood.
*   **Photo-Eye Test:** Wave a broom handle in front of the sensors while the door is closing. It should reverse immediately.

## Lubrication
*   **Springs:** Spray with garage door lubricant.
*   **Rollers:** Lubricate the bearings (if metal).
*   **Hinges:** Spray the pivot points.
*   **Tracks:** **DO NOT** lubricate the tracks! Wipe them clean with a rag.

## Weatherstripping
*   **Bottom Seal:** Check the rubber seal at the bottom of the door. Is it cracked or brittle? If you can see daylight under the door, it's time to replace it.

## When to Call a Pro
If you find broken springs, frayed cables, or if the door fails the balance or safety tests, call Ez2Fix for a professional tune-up.
