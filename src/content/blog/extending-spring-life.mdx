Garage door springs have a finite life, usually rated in cycles (e.g., 10,000 cycles). While you can't stop them from eventually breaking, you can delay the inevitable.

## 1. Lubricate Regularly
We can't say this enough. Rust is the enemy of springs. It increases friction and weakens the steel coils. Spray your springs with garage door lubricant every 3-6 months to keep them moving smoothly.

## 2. Check Door Balance
If your springs are losing tension, they have to work harder to lift the door. An unbalanced door puts uneven stress on the coils. Perform a balance test (lift manually to waist height) twice a year. If it's not balanced, call a pro to adjust the tension.

## 3. Minimize Cycles
Every time you open and close the door, you use one "cycle."
*   Don't use the garage door as a front door.
*   If you're just grabbing a bike or a rake, use the side door if you have one.
*   Avoid "partial" openings. Opening it halfway and closing it still counts as stress on the spring.

## 4. Keep the Tracks Clean
Dirty tracks cause the door to bind, which forces the springs (and opener) to pull harder. Wipe them down regularly.

## High-Cycle Springs
When it is finally time to replace them, ask Ez2Fix about "high-cycle" springs. For a little extra cost, we can install springs rated for 20,000 or 30,000 cycles, effectively doubling or tripling their lifespan.
