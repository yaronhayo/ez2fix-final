Seeing your garage door hanging crookedly or with rollers popped out of the tracks is alarming. An off-track door is unstable and dangerous. Here is exactly what you should do.

## Immediate Safety Steps

1.  **Stop Operating the Door:** Do not try to open or close it with the remote. This will only cause further damage to the door panels, tracks, and opener.
2.  **Clear the Area:** Keep children, pets, and vehicles away from the door. It could fall completely at any moment.
3.  **Disconnect the Opener:** Pull the red emergency release cord to disengage the motor. This prevents someone from accidentally activating it.

## Why Did It Come Off Track?
*   **Hit by a Car:** Even a low-speed bump can bend the tracks.
*   **Broken Cable:** If one lift cable snaps, the weight shifts to one side, causing the door to twist and pop out.
*   **Loose Tracks:** Vibration can loosen the bolts holding the tracks to the wall.
*   **Obstructions:** Closing the door on an object (like a broom handle) can force it out of alignment.

## Can I Fix It Myself?
**We strongly advise against DIY repair for off-track doors.**
The garage door springs are under immense tension. When a door is off track, that tension is unstable. Trying to force the rollers back in can cause the spring to release its energy violently, or the door could fall on you.

## The Professional Solution
Ez2Fix technicians have the tools to safely secure the door, release the spring tension, realign the tracks, and reseat the rollers. We also inspect the door for any bent panels or damaged hinges that caused the issue.

**Call us immediately if your door is off track.** It is an emergency situation that requires professional attention.
