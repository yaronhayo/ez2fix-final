The average garage door opens and closes 1,500 times a year. That's a lot of vibration. Over time, this vibration loosens the nuts and bolts that hold the track and hardware together.

## Tools You Need
*   Socket wrench set (usually 7/16" or 1/2")
*   Stepladder

## What to Tighten
1.  **Roller Brackets:** These hold the rollers to the door. Tighten the bolts that secure them to the door panel.
2.  **Hinges:** Tighten the screws holding the hinges to the door sections.
3.  **Track Bolts:** Check the bolts that secure the track brackets to the wall framing.
4.  **Opener Hardware:** Check the bolts holding the opener motor to the ceiling and the arm that connects the door to the trolley.

## What NOT to Tighten (DANGER ZONE)
**Red-Headed Bolts:** Some bolts, especially on the bottom brackets (where the cable attaches), are often painted red. **NEVER touch these.** They are under extreme tension from the springs. Loosening them can cause the cable to snap or the bracket to fly off, causing serious injury.

## Pro Tip
Don't overtighten! You can strip the screw holes in the thin metal door panels. Just snug them up until they are firm.
