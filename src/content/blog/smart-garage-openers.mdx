Gone are the days of wondering, "Did I close the garage door?" halfway to work. Smart garage door openers (like LiftMaster with myQ technology) connect to your home Wi-Fi, putting control in the palm of your hand.

## Key Features
1.  **Remote Control:** Open or close your door from anywhere in the world using your smartphone app.
2.  **Real-Time Alerts:** Get a notification instantly if your door opens or is left open for too long.
3.  **Guest Access:** Give temporary access to a dog walker or contractor without sharing your keypad code.
4.  **Amazon Key:** Securely receive Amazon packages inside your garage to prevent porch piracy.
5.  **Schedules:** Set your door to automatically close every night at 10 PM.

## Is It Secure?
Yes. Modern smart openers use encrypted signals that are much harder to hack than old remote frequencies. Plus, the ability to monitor the door gives you peace of mind.

## How to Upgrade
You can either replace your entire opener with a new smart model (recommended if yours is 15+ years old) or add a "smart hub" retrofit kit to your existing opener.
