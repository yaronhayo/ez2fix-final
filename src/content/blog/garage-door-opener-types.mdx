Not all garage door openers are created equal. The drive mechanism determines how noisy, expensive, and durable the opener will be.

## 1. Chain Drive
Uses a metal chain (like a bicycle) to lift the door.
*   **Pros:** Reliable, strong, affordable.
*   **Cons:** Noisy. The metal-on-metal contact creates vibration.
*   **Best For:** Detached garages or heavy wood doors where noise isn't an issue.

## 2. Belt Drive
Uses a steel-reinforced rubber belt.
*   **Pros:** Extremely quiet. Smooth operation. Low maintenance.
*   **Cons:** More expensive than chain drives.
*   **Best For:** Attached garages, especially if there is a living space above or next to the garage.

## 3. Screw Drive
Uses a threaded steel rod that rotates to move the trolley.
*   **Pros:** Fast opening speed. Fewer moving parts.
*   **Cons:** Can be noisy. Sensitive to temperature changes (requires lubrication).
*   **Best For:** Climates with stable temperatures (less common in NJ now).

## 4. Wall Mount (Jackshaft)
Mounts on the wall beside the door, turning the torsion bar directly.
*   **Pros:** Frees up ceiling space for storage. Very quiet.
*   **Cons:** Most expensive option. Requires specific clearance.
*   **Best For:** Garages with high ceilings or cathedral ceilings.

## Our Recommendation
For most homes, a **Belt Drive** opener is the gold standard for its quiet operation and reliability.
