When the power goes out, your automatic garage door opener becomes a paperweight. But you don't have to be trapped. Every opener has a manual release mechanism—that red rope hanging from the trolley.

## When to Use It
*   **Power Outage:** To open the door manually.
*   **Broken Opener:** If the motor fails.
*   **Maintenance:** To disconnect the door for testing balance.

**WARNING:** Only use the release cord when the garage door is **CLOSED**. If you pull it when the door is open, and the springs are weak or broken, the door could crash down, causing severe injury or damage.

## How to Disconnect (Go into Manual Mode)
1.  **Ensure the Door is Closed.**
2.  **Pull the Red Cord Down and Back:** Pull the handle down and towards the motor. You should hear a click as the trolley disconnects from the carriage.
3.  **Lift the Door:** You should now be able to lift the door manually. If it's too heavy to lift, you may have a broken spring (stop and call a pro).

## How to Reconnect (Go back to Automatic)
1.  **Close the Door:** Manually lower the door to the ground.
2.  **Pull the Cord Toward the Door:** Pull the red handle toward the door opening (away from the motor). This resets the spring lever on the trolley.
3.  **Run the Opener:** Press your remote or wall button. The trolley will move along the track and automatically snap back into the carriage with a loud click.
4.  **Test:** The door should now operate automatically.

## Cord Broken?
If your emergency release cord has snapped, don't replace it with a regular rope. Call Ez2Fix for a proper replacement handle and cord to ensure safety.
