You've picked out your new door, and installation day is scheduled. Here is what you need to do before the Ez2Fix team arrives to ensure the job goes quickly and safely.

## 1. Clear the Area
We need room to work! Please clear a workspace about **10 feet back** from the door opening. Move bikes, lawnmowers, and boxes to the back of the garage or outside.

## 2. Move Your Cars
Park your cars in the street or down the block. We will need the driveway clear to park our truck and unload the new door panels.

## 3. Keep Pets and Kids Away
Garage door installation involves heavy lifting, power tools, and tensioned springs. For everyone's safety, please keep children and pets inside the house.

## 4. Locate Power Outlets
We will need access to a power outlet for our tools and to plug in the new opener.

## 5. Remove Wall Hangings
If you have shelves or decorations mounted near the door tracks or opener motor, please take them down so they don't get knocked over or obstruct the installation.

## What to Expect
Most installations take **3-5 hours**. We will remove and haul away your old door, install the new track and panels, hook up the opener, and clean up all debris before we leave.
