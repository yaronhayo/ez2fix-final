When shopping for a new garage door, the first question you'll be asked is: "Insulated or non-insulated?" Here is a breakdown to help you decide.

## Uninsulated Doors (Single Layer)
These are made of a single sheet of steel.
*   **Pros:** Lowest cost. Lightweight.
*   **Cons:** Flimsy (dents easily). Noisy (rattles in the wind). Zero thermal protection.
*   **Best For:** Detached garages where temperature doesn't matter.

## Insulated Doors (Double or Triple Layer)
These have a layer of polystyrene or polyurethane foam, often sandwiched between two layers of steel.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Energy Efficient:** Keeps the garage warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
    *   **Durable:** The foam core makes the door rigid and resistant to dents.
    *   **Quiet:** Absorbs vibration and sound.
*   **Cons:** Higher upfront cost. Heavier (requires stronger springs).
*   **Best For:** Attached garages, especially if you have a bedroom above the garage.

## The Verdict
For most homeowners in New Jersey, an **insulated door is the better investment**. The energy savings and increased durability pay for the difference over time.
