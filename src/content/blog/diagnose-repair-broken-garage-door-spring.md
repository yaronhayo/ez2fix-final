*Last updated: January 15, 2025 | 8 min read*

## Signs Your Garage Door Spring is Broken {#signs}

**How do you know if your garage door spring is broken?** Here are the most common signs:

1. **Door Won't Open** - The most obvious sign. If your garage door opener runs but the door doesn't move more than a few inches, a broken spring is likely the culprit.

2. **Loud Bang** - Garage door springs store immense tension. When they break, they make a loud "gunshot" sound that can wake you at night.

3. **Visible Gap in Torsion Spring** - If you have torsion springs (mounted above the door), look for a 2-3 inch gap in the spring coils.

4. **Door Opens Crooked** - For extension springs (on sides), one broken spring causes the door to lift unevenly.

5. **Door Feels Heavy** - A spring-less garage door weighs 150-300 pounds. If it feels extremely heavy when lifting manually, springs may be broken.

6. **Opener Motor Strains** - The opener motor runs but makes grinding noises and can't lift the door.

## Torsion Springs vs Extension Springs {#types}

Understanding what type of springs you have is critical before attempting any repair.

### Torsion Springs

**Location:** Mounted horizontally above the garage door opening  
**How they work:** Wind and unwind to lift/lower the door  
**Lifespan:** 10,000-20,000 cycles (5-7 years with normal use)  
**Difficulty to replace:** VERY DIFFICULT - requires specialized tools and is extremely dangerous

**Pros:**
- More durable and longer-lasting
- Smoother, quieter operation
- Fewer break-related accidents

**Cons:**
- More expensive to replace ($150-$300 professional installation)
- Very dangerous to replace DIY

### Extension Springs

**Location:** Mounted on the sides of the door above the horizontal tracks  
**How they work:** Stretch and contract as door moves  
**Lifespan:** 7,000-12,000 cycles (4-6 years)  
**Difficulty to replace:** DIFFICULT - still dangerous but slightly easier than torsion

**Pros:**
- Less expensive ($50-$120 per spring)
- Slightly safer for DIY (with proper safety cables)

**Cons:**
- Break more frequently
- Can cause more damage when they break
- Noisier operation

## Safety Risks of DIY Spring Repair {#safety}

**⚠️ WARNING: We strongly recommend hiring a licensed professional for spring replacement.**

Here's why:

### Extreme Tension
- A single torsion spring can exert 200-300 pounds of force
- When improperly handled, springs can cause:
  - Broken fingers or hands
  - Facial injuries
  - Severe lacerations
  - Loss of eyesight
  - Death (rare but documented)

### Special Tools Required
- Winding bars (not screwdrivers!)
- C-clamps
- Wrenches
- Ladder
- Safety glasses
- Gloves

### Common DIY Mistakes
1. Using wrong size replacement spring (causes premature failure)
2. Under-winding or over-winding
3. Not securing door during replacement
4. Releasing tension too quickly
5. Not installing safety cables on extension springs

**Emergency rooms in Northern NJ treat dozens of garage door spring injuries every year. Don't become a statistic.**

## Step-by-Step Diagnosis Process {#diagnosis}

If you want to diagnose the problem before calling a professional, here's a safe process:

### Step 1: Disconnect the Opener
1. Pull the red emergency release cord
2. Manually try to lift the door about 3-4 feet
3. Let go - does it stay in place or fall?

**If it falls:** Springs are definitely broken or severely worn

### Step 2: Visual Inspection

**For Torsion Springs:**
- Look above the door for the spring(s)
- Check for a visible gap (2-3 inches) in the coils
- Look for rust or corrosion
- Check if spring looks stretched or deformed

**For Extension Springs:**
- Look on both sides above the door tracks
- Check if one side looks slack
- Inspect for breaks or separation
- Verify safety cables are present

### Step 3: Count Remaining Cycles

If springs aren't broken yet but you're concerned about lifespan:

**Average use:** 4 cycles per day = 1,460 cycles/year  
**10,000-cycle spring:** Lasts ~6-7 years  
**Know your door's age?** Multiply years × 1,460 = approximate cycles used

## When to Call a Professional {#professional}

**Call a licensed garage door technician if:**

1. ✅ Torsion spring is broken (DO NOT DIY)
2. ✅ Extension spring is broken and you're not 100% confident
3. ✅ You don't have the specialized tools
4. ✅ You value your safety and time
5. ✅ The door is double-wide or oversized
6. ✅ Springs are custom or hard-to-find sizes

### Benefits of Professional Repair

**Average DIY time:** 3-6 hours (if everything goes right)  
**Professional time:** 45 minutes to 1.5 hours  
**Professional cost:** $150-$350 (parts + labor)  
**DIY hospital visit:** $5,000-$50,000+ (seriously, it happens)

**What you get with a pro:**
- Correct spring tension calibration
- Proper cable adjustment
- Full door balance testing
- Safety inspection of all components
- Warranty on parts and labor
- Zero risk of injury

## FAQ About Broken Garage Door Springs {#faq}

### How much does garage door spring replacement cost?

**Torsion springs:** $150-$300 installed (single door), $250-$400 (double wide)  
**Extension springs:** $100-$200 installed per pair

Factors affecting cost: door size, spring type, accessibility, additional repairs needed.

### How long do garage door springs last?

Standard torsion springs last 10,000-20,000 cycles (5-10 years). Extension springs last 7,000-12,000 cycles (4-6 years). Heavy daily use shortens lifespan.

### Can I replace just one spring?

For extension springs, yes - but we recommend replacing both sides for balanced operation. For torsion springs, if one breaks, the other is likely near failure, so replacing both saves you a second service call.

### Will my garage door opener work with a broken spring?

No. The spring does 90% of the door's lifting work. Without functioning springs, your opener motor will strain, overheat, and potentially burn out. Do not repeatedly try to open a door with broken springs.

### How can I make my springs last longer?

1. Lubricate springs 2x per year with silicone spray
2. Keep door balanced - test annually
3. Don't over-cycle the door unnecessarily
4. Install high-cycle springs (20,000+ cycles)
5. Keep moisture out of garage (rust accelerates failure)

## Conclusion

While it's possible to diagnose a broken garage door spring yourself, replacement is inherently dangerous and ideally left to licensed professionals. The risks of injury far outweigh the cost savings of DIY repair.
