Buying a new garage door is a big investment that can transform the look of your home. But with so many styles and materials, where do you start? Here is a simple guide to help you decide.

## 1. Choose Your Style
*   **Traditional:** Classic raised panels. Fits almost any home style (Colonials, Ranches, etc.).
*   **Carriage House:** Looks like old-fashioned swing-out doors but opens overhead. Adds rustic charm.
*   **Modern/Contemporary:** Flush panels or full-view glass. Perfect for mid-century modern or contemporary homes.

## 2. Pick Your Material
*   **Steel:** The most popular choice. Durable, low maintenance, and affordable.
*   **Wood:** Beautiful and authentic, but requires regular painting or staining. Expensive.
*   **Faux Wood (Composite):** The look of wood with the durability of steel.
*   **Aluminum & Glass:** sleek and modern, lets in lots of light.

## 3. Insulation Level
*   **Non-Insulated:** Cheapest option. Good for detached garages.
*   **Polystyrene (Styrofoam):** Good value, adds some rigidity and warmth.
*   **Polyurethane:** The best insulation. Foam is injected into the door, making it incredibly strong and energy-efficient.

## 4. Windows or No Windows?
Windows add style and natural light. You can choose from various glass types (clear, frosted, seeded) and insert designs to match your home's windows.

## 5. Budget
Set a budget early. Steel doors are budget-friendly, while custom wood or glass doors are premium options. Don't forget to factor in the cost of a new opener if yours is old!
