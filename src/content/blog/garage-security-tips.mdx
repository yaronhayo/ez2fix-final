The garage door is a favorite target for burglars. It's often easier to breach than a front door and offers privacy once they're inside. Here’s how to lock them out.

## 1. Keep the Remote Inside
Don't leave your garage door remote clipped to your car visor. If a thief breaks into your car (even in the driveway), they have a key to your house. Get a keychain remote or use a smart phone app instead.

## 2. The "Zip Tie" Trick
Thieves can use a coat hanger to fish for the emergency release cord and pull it, disengaging the door so they can lift it manually.
*   **The Fix:** Remove the release cord handle (you can still reach the knot if needed) or use a zip tie to secure the release latch to the carriage. This prevents it from being pulled from the outside but can still be broken with a strong tug from the inside in an emergency.

## 3. Smart Garage Openers
Upgrade to a Wi-Fi opener (like LiftMaster MyQ). These allow you to:
*   Get alerts if the door opens.
*   Close the door remotely from your phone.
*   Set schedules to ensure the door closes automatically at night.

## 4. Frost the Windows
If you have windows, thieves can peek in to see if your car is there or spot valuable tools. Apply a frosted film to let light in while blocking the view.

## 5. Lock the Door to the House
Treat the door between your garage and your house like an exterior door. Install a deadbolt and keep it locked.
