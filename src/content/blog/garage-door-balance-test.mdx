Your garage door opener is designed to lift a *balanced* door, not dead weight. The springs do 90% of the lifting; the opener just guides it. If your springs are weak or the door is unbalanced, the opener has to work overtime, leading to stripped gears and burnt-out motors.

## What is a Balanced Door?
A balanced door is one where the spring tension equals the weight of the door. It should be easy to lift manually and should stay put when you let go.

## How to Perform a Balance Test
**Safety First:** Do this when the garage is clear.

1.  **Close the Door:** Start with the door fully closed.
2.  **Disconnect the Opener:** Pull the red emergency release cord.
3.  **Lift the Door:** Lift the door manually. It should move smoothly with little resistance.
4.  **Stop at Waist Height:** Lift the door about halfway up (3-4 feet) and let go.
    *   **Balanced:** The door stays in place or drifts slightly.
    *   **Unbalanced (Springs too weak):** The door slams down.
    *   **Unbalanced (Springs too strong):** The door shoots up.

## The Verdict
*   **If it slams down:** Your springs have lost tension and need adjustment or replacement.
*   **If it shoots up:** The springs are wound too tight (rare, but happens).

## What to Do
**Do not try to adjust the springs yourself.** Call Ez2Fix. We can safely add tension to your springs to get your door perfectly balanced again, saving your opener from early failure.
