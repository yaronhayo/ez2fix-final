You press the button, but the garage door stays shut. Is the remote broken? Is the opener dead? Before you buy a new system, try these troubleshooting steps to get your remote working again.

## 1. Check the Lock Button
Many wall control panels have a "Lock" or "Vacation" button. If this is activated, the opener will ignore all remote signals for security.
*   **The Fix:** Check your wall console and ensure the lock feature is turned off. The LED light on the wall button is often blinking if it's locked.

## 2. Replace the Battery
We mentioned this before, but it's the #1 cause. Even if the little light on the remote turns on, the battery might be too weak to send a strong signal.
*   **The Fix:** Swap in a fresh battery.

## 3. Reprogram the Remote
Sometimes, power surges or glitches can cause the opener to "forget" the remote code.
*   **The Fix:** Locate the "Learn" button on your opener motor unit (usually near the antenna wire). Press it, then press the button on your remote within 30 seconds. The light on the opener should flash to confirm it's paired.

## 4. Check for Interference
LED light bulbs are great for energy saving, but cheap ones can emit radio frequency interference that blocks your remote signal.
*   **The Fix:** Unscrew any LED bulbs in your garage door opener. If the remote starts working, replace them with "garage door opener compatible" LED bulbs that are shielded.

## 5. Antenna Position
Ensure the small antenna wire hanging from the motor unit isn't damaged or tucked up inside the housing. It should be hanging straight down for the best reception.

## Still Not Working?
If the wall button works but the remote doesn't (and you've tried all the above), the receiver logic board in the opener might be failing. Ez2Fix can diagnose the issue and replace the board or the remote if needed.
