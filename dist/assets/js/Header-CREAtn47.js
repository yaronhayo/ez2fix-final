    overview: `Did you hear a loud "gunshot" sound from your garage? That's the sound of a spring snapping under extreme tension. The spring is the muscle of your garage door, lifting 90% of its weight. When it breaks, your door becomes dead weight—often over 200 lbs—and is dangerous to try and lift. We specialize in high-cycle spring replacement, using springs rated for 25,000+ cycles (double the industry standard). We replace both torsion and extension springs with precision-calibrated parts that ensure your door balances perfectly and lifts effortlessly.`,

        question: "Can I replace a garage door spring myself?",

        answer: "A smart garage door opener connects to your home WiFi network and allows you to control your garage door from anywhere using a smartphone app. You can open/close your door remotely, receive  notifications when it opens or closes, and even grant temporary access to guests or delivery drivers. Smart openers work with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit for voice control."

        question: "Which smart garage door opener brand should I choose?",
        answer: "We recommend LiftMaster MyQ for the most features and reliability, with battery backup and Security+ 2.0 rolling code technology. Chamberlain offers excellent value with MyQ smart technology built-in. Genie Aladdin Connect is budget-friendly with solid WiFi features. All three integrate with major smart home platforms. We'll help you choose based on your budget and specific needs."

        question: "Do smart openers work with Amazon Alexa and Google Home?",
        answer: 'Yes! LiftMaster MyQ, Chamberlain, and Genie Aladdin Connect all work with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit. You can use voice commands like "Alexa, close the garage door" or check status by asking "Hey Google, is my garage door open?" We can set up the integration during installation.'
      },
      {
        question: "Can I add smart features to my existing garage door opener?",
        answer: "Yes, if your current opener was manufactured after 1993. You can add a smart garage door controller like the Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Hub ($30-50) or Nexx Garage. These devices connect to your existing opener and provide smartphone control. We'll assess compatibility during a free consultation."
      },
      {
        question: "Are smart garage openers secure? Can they be hacked?",
        answer: "Modern smart openers use bank-level 128-bit encryption and Security+ 2.0 rolling code technology that changes the access code after every use, making them extremely difficult to hack. They're significantly more secure than older fixed-code openers. We only install openers with proven security features and can explain all security measures during installation."
      },
      {
        question: "Do smart garage openers work without WiFi or during power outages?",
        answer: "If WiFi goes down, you lose remote app control but can still use the wall button and physical remotes. During power outages, most smart openers (especially LiftMaster) include battery backup that allows 20-50 door cycles without electricity. The door will work normally, but app notifications won't function until power and WiFi are restored."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does smart garage door opener installation take?",
        answer: "Professional installation typically takes 2-3 hours, including physical installation, WiFi setup, app configuration, and training. If you want smart home integration (Alexa, Google Home), add 30-60 minutes. We schedule installations at your convenience and complete everything in one visit."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between belt drive and chain drive openers?",
        answer: "Belt drive openers use a rubber belt and are ultra-quiet (ideal for garages under bedrooms), while chain drives use a metal chain and are louder but more affordable. Belt drives cost $50-$100 more but are worth it for attached garages. Both are available as smart openers with WiFi. We'll recommend the option for your situation."
