My garage door opener stopped working and Ez2Fix came out the next day. The technician diagnosed the issue promptly, replaced the circuit board, and had everything working in under an hour. Very professional and reasonably priced. I would definitely use them again."</p> <div class="mt-auto pt-4 border-t border-gray-50"> <div class="flex items-center"> <div class="w-10 h-10 bg-gold-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-gold-700 font-bold text-lg mr-3"> P </div> <div> <div class="font-bold text-dark-800">Patricia H.</div> <div class="text-xs text-gray-500">Montclair</div> </div> </div> <div class="mt-3 inline-flex items-center text-xs font-medium text-gold-600 bg-gold-50 px-2 py-1 rounded"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-wrench w-3 h-3 mr-1" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M14.7 6.3a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.4l1.6 1.6a1 1 0 0 0 1.4 0l3.106-3.105c.32-.322.863-.22.983.218a6 6 0 0 1-8.259 7.057l-7.91 7.91a1 1 0 0 1-2.999-3l7.91-7.91a6 6 0 0 1 7.057-8.259c.438.12.54.662.219.984z"></path></svg> Opener Repair </div> </div> </div> </div><div class="review-card hidden" data-index="9"> <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100 h-full flex flex-col hover:shadow-md transition-shadow"> <div class="flex items-center justify-between mb-4"> <div class="flex items-center space-x-1" aria-label="Rated 5 out of 5 stars"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-star" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M11.525 2.295a.53.53 0 0 1 .95 0l2.31 4.679a2.123 2.123 0 0 0 1.595 1.16l5.166.756a.53.53 0 0 1 .294.904l-3.736 3.638a2.123 2.123 0 0 0-.611 1.878l.882 5.14a.53.53 0 0 1-.771.56l-4.618-2.428a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-1.973 0L6.396 21.01a.53.53 0 0 1-.77-.56l.881-5.139a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-.611-1.879L2.16 9.795a.53.53 0 0 1 .294-.906l5.165-.755a2.122 2.122 0 0 0 1.597-1.16z"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-star" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M11.525 2.295a.53.53 0 0 1 .95 0l2.31 4.679a2.123 2.123 0 0 0 1.595 1.16l5.166.756a.53.53 0 0 1 .294.904l-3.736 3.638a2.123 2.123 0 0 0-.611 1.878l.882 5.14a.53.53 0 0 1-.771.56l-4.618-2.428a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-1.973 0L6.396 21.01a.53.53 0 0 1-.77-.56l.881-5.139a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-.611-1.879L2.16 9.795a.53.53 0 0 1 .294-.906l5.165-.755a2.122 2.122 0 0 0 1.597-1.16z"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-star" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M11.525 2.295a.53.53 0 0 1 .95 0l2.31 4.679a2.123 2.123 0 0 0 1.595 1.16l5.166.756a.53.53 0 0 1 .294.904l-3.736 3.638a2.123 2.123 0 0 0-.611 1.878l.882 5.14a.53.53 0 0 1-.771.56l-4.618-2.428a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-1.973 0L6.396 21.01a.53.53 0 0 1-.77-.56l.881-5.139a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-.611-1.879L2.16 9.795a.53.53 0 0 1 .294-.906l5.165-.755a2.122 2.122 0 0 0 1.597-1.16z"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-star" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M11.525 2.295a.53.53 0 0 1 .95 0l2.31 4.679a2.123 2.123 0 0 0 1.595 1.16l5.166.756a.53.53 0 0 1 .294.904l-3.736 3.638a2.123 2.123 0 0 0-.611 1.878l.882 5.14a.53.53 0 0 1-.771.56l-4.618-2.428a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-1.973 0L6.396 21.01a.53.53 0 0 1-.77-.56l.881-5.139a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-.611-1.879L2.16 9.795a.53.53 0 0 1 .294-.906l5.165-.755a2.122 2.122 0 0 0 1.597-1.16z"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-star" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M11.525 2.295a.53.53 0 0 1 .95 0l2.31 4.679a2.123 2.123 0 0 0 1.595 1.16l5.166.756a.53.53 0 0 1 .294.904l-3.736 3.638a2.123 2.123 0 0 0-.611 1.878l.882 5.14a.53.53 0 0 1-.771.56l-4.618-2.428a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-1.973 0L6.396 21.01a.53.53 0 0 1-.77-.56l.881-5.139a2.122 2.122 0 0 0-.611-1.879L2.16 9.795a.53.53 0 0 1 .294-.906l5.165-.755a2.122 2.122 0 0 0 1.597-1.16z"></path></svg> </div> <span class="text-sm text-gray-400">4 months ago</span> </div> <p class="text-dark-600 mb-6 flex-grow leading-relaxed">"Ez2Fix replaced two damaged panels on my garage door.
